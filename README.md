# We Love Movies Project Overview

In the WeLoveMovies project, I developed an application that allows users to access movie information, including theaters, reviews, and reviewer details. Here's a summary of what I accomplished during the project:

- Set up the project by creating routes to handle incoming requests from users.
- Implemented unit tests to ensure the functionality of the application and ran them from the command line.
- Utilized route and query parameters to access and process relevant information based on user requests.
- Implemented an error handler to handle cases where a requested route does not exist.
- Designed and built the API following RESTful design principles to ensure a standardized and intuitive interface for users.
- Created and customized a `knexfile.js` configuration file to establish a connection with the database using Knex.
- Established a connection to the database with Knex, enabling communication and data retrieval.
- Wrote database queries using Knex to complete CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) routes in an Express server.
- Retrieved joined and nested data from the database using Knex, enabling more comprehensive and informative responses to user requests.
- Utilized Knex's migration tools to write and execute database migrations, facilitating the management of database schema changes.
- Deployed the backend server to a cloud service, ensuring its availability for users. Note that deploying the frontend was not necessary for this project.

For the frontend part of the application, the provided starter code from the repository [here](https://github.com/Thinkful-Ed/starter-movie-front-end) was used.

Overall, the WeLoveMovies project involved the development of a robust backend application with a focus on database integration, routing, and API design.
